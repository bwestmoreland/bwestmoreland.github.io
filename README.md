A Simple Blog for Sharing Markdown on the Web
=============================================

This is a simple collection of thoughts and presentations from my addled brain.

##License

I'd love to give this stuff away via the BSD license. Unfortunately I probably stole it myself so it really isn't mine to give it away.  If you're one of the people I've offended via my mad google image hack skills, send me a message via twitter @bwestmoreland and I'll remove the offending content.

Everything under `_posts` is original and is available under the BSD license.  

##Theme

If you like this Bootstrap theme, go buy it.  It's available [here][oxygenna]
