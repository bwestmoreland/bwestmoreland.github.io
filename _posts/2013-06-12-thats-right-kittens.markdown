So, for an introductory post, I thought I would introduce my new favorite web service, [Place Kitten][placekitten]

You just give it a size, say 200w x 300h and include a /g if you want black and white.

{% highlight html linenos %}

<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/300">

{% endhighlight %}

[You're welcome.][welcome]
